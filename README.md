# 📚 JavaScript Backend Learning Repository

This repository contains my personal learning path while studying **JavaScript for Backend Development**.

I'm currently a programming student at UTN and I'm building this repo as a way to:

* Practice core JavaScript concepts
* Understand how Node.js works under the hood
* Learn asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
* Apply modularization using ES Modules
* Prepare for real backend development using tools like Express and PostgreSQL in future projects

The goal is to move from fundamental concepts to production-ready backend architecture.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🟢 01-basics

This folder contains fundamental JavaScript concepts required before working with Node.js or any backend framework.

Topics covered:

* Variables & Data Types
* Conditionals
* Arrays
* Loops
* Functions
* Objects
* Destructuring & Spread
* Classes
* Error Handling
* Console Methods
* ES Modules (import/export)

Each topic includes:

* Concept explanation through code
* Practice exercises

---

### 🟡 02-async *(Work in Progress)*

This section focuses on **Asynchronous JavaScript**, which is a core concept for backend development.

Topics being covered:

* Callbacks
* Callback Hell
* Promises *(coming soon)*
* Async / Await *(coming soon)*
* Event Loop *(coming soon)*
* Error handling in async flows *(coming soon)*

⚠️ This folder is actively being updated as I continue learning.
New examples and exercises will be added progressively.

## 🧠 Why This Repository?

Understanding asynchronous behavior is essential when working with:

* APIs
* Databases (PostgreSQL)
* File Systems
* Authentication
* External services

Everything in backend development is async by nature, so mastering this is a priority in my current roadmap.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Planned topics to be added:

* Node.js Core Modules
* Express.js
* REST API Development
* MVC Architecture
* Database Integration (PostgreSQL)
* Authentication (JWT)
* Environment Configuration
* Deployment

## 📌 Note

This repository reflects my current learning process.
Code may evolve or be refactored as I gain more experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies

* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Node.js
